### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and write the prompt for that with the unit 2 Prompt types given above.

Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.

Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

Comparative Analysis Prompt
Definition: Asking for a comparison between two or more concepts, often highlighting similarities and differences.
•	"Compare and contrast deep learning and machine learning."
•	"How do renewable and non-renewable energy sources differ?"

Experiential Perspective Prompt:
> 	“As a software engineer, what are the benefits of using cloud computing in your projects?”
>  “From a student’s perspective, describe the challenges of online learning.”

Everyday Functioning Prompts:
*	  “Describe the role of machine learning in everyday apps like YouTube or Netflix."
*	 	“How is encryption used in daily life when sending WhatsApp messages?”

Universal Prompt Structures:
^ 	“Explain [concept] in simple terms with an example.”
^  “Explain the process of [task] step by step.”

Prompt Size Limitations:
&  	“Translate this 5000-word essay into Tamil.”
→ Manageable chunks: “Translate the first 1000 words into Tamil, then continue.”
&  “Give me 50 examples of AI applications.”
→ Adjust for size: “Give me 10 AI applications at a time.”

### Comparison :

### Gemini AI : 

1.Comparative Analysis Prompt 

```
Compare and contrast Waterfall and Agile (specifically Scrum) software development methodologies across the following three dimensions: stakeholder involvement, risk management, and time-to-market.

Your analysis must:

i. Identify 3 major philosophical and practical differences.

ii. Conclude by arguing which methodology is demonstrably superior for developing a long-term medical device software with strict regulatory requirements.
```

2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

```
Software architecture provides the fundamental structure for any system, defining how components interact. Identify and briefly describe the three most common architectural patterns used in modern web applications. Your descriptions must be concise, focusing only on the primary benefit and a concrete example for each pattern.
```

3. Everyday Functioning Prompts

```
Describe the everyday functioning of a Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant's kitchen operation during the crucial two-hour window between 5:00 PM (pre-service prep) and 7:00 PM (peak seating). Specifically, detail the flow of communication, the role of the expediter (Expeditor), and the most frequent point of friction or bottleneck in the system.
```
 
4. Universal Prompt Structures Prompt Refinements

```
Original Broad Prompt:
"Discuss the economic impact of climate change policies."

Refined Prompt (Universal Structures Applied):

"Analyze the economic impact of a carbon tax policy versus a cap-and-trade system on the manufacturing sector in the EU over a 10−year period. Specifically, compare the two policy mechanisms based on their influence on investment certainty, innovation incentive, and consumer price volatility, providing one quantitative data point (hypothetical or real) to support the analysis of each policy's effect."

The refinement forces a Comparative Analysis (tax vs. cap-and-trade), specifies the Domain (EU manufacturing), sets a Time Constraint (10 years), and demands Specific Metrics (certainty, incentive, volatility) and Data/Evidence (quantitative point).
```

5. Prompt Size Limitations design an AI

```
Summarize the benefits of microservices architecture for a CTO in three bullet points.
```

### ChatGPT : 

1.Comparative Analysis Prompt 

```
Compare and contrast the leadership styles of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. How did their approaches to nonviolent protest shape their respective movements?
```

2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

```
Describe a time when you faced a significant challenge and how it shaped your personal growth. What lessons did you take from that experience?
```

3. Everyday Functioning Prompts

```
Describe your daily morning routine and explain how it helps you stay productive throughout the day.
```
 
4. Universal Prompt Structures Prompt Refinements

```
Basic Prompt:
Write about climate change.

Refined / Universal Prompt:
Analyze the causes and consequences of climate change globally. Discuss how human activities contribute to it and suggest actionable solutions for individuals and governments.
```

5. Prompt Size Limitations design an AI

```
Scenario / Prompt:
You are designing an AI chatbot that helps users plan their weekly meals. However, the AI has a token limit of 150 tokens per prompt.

Optimized Prompt (fits size limitations):
"Create a 7-day meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Include calories and basic recipes. Assume vegetarian diet."
```
